## My business card site
### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

This project is my first serious website and the first project after two years of severe depression and attempts to take my own life.
I struggled with this disease for 2 years, and after a long therapy, I returned to programming. Completely burned out, I am trying to find my own business, which would become my calling and meaning.

I decided to start my return to life with a simple business card site, written completely from scratch.

Briefly about what was done:
âš«Added full adaptability for all device screen sizes<br>
âš«Completely redesigned color scheme and user-friendliness of the interface as a whole<br>
âš«Added change of design themes (light/night/classic)<br>
âš«The site structure was completely redesigned for the BEM system<br>
âš«Added many tactile elements for the user<br>
âš«Working with local storage and login are written in pure JS.<br>
âš«Created a mobile version of the project, which works great on any device up to iPhone 15<br>
âš«Created drop-down menus and a mobile menu<br>
âš«Worked with CSS semantics<br>
âš«Worked with media queries<br>
âš«This site is made in pure CSS and JS using BEM and is my calling card<br>

What was involved: CSS3, HTML5, JS, GIT

This is how the site versions changed:
